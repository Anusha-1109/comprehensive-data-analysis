# Comprehensive data analysis
A Python-based command-line tool designed to perform comprehensive statistical analysis on one, two and multiple columns of data from CSV or tab-delimited text files. Built to support both numeric (continuous or discrete) and categorical data, offering a range of descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, normality assessments.

The script is executed via the command line, taking a file path/file as an argument. It prompts users to select analysis type (single-column, two-column or multiple-column), specify column names, and provide parameters such as custom percentiles or hypothesized values for hypothesis tests. Outputs include a statistical summary file, few visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, box plots), and a detailed log file capturing all terminal interactions.

The script serves multiple purposes:

1- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides detailed descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, percentiles, null counts) to summarize data distributions.

2- Hypothesis Testing: Conducts statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Wilcoxon test, Chi-Square test) to evaluate hypotheses about means, medians, proportions, or associations.

3- Normality Assessment: Performs tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling) to check if numeric data follows a normal distribution.

4- Data Visualization: Generates plots (e.g., box plots, histograms, frequency plots) to visually represent data distributions and relationships.

5- Reproducibility: Saves statistical results, visualizations, and a log file for documentation and future reference.
